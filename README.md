# Identification and separation of active galaxy spectra by the HÎ± emission line

![Alt text](/galaxies/spec-figure.png?raw=true "Galaxy scpectrum plot")

Separates active and non-active galaxies by averaging the H-alpha and the rest of the spectrum. The insertion of the reading files must be .fits, but editing the source code it is possible to insert other formats. "Fits" files must have two dimensions.
